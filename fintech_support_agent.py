Support Agent: Multi-Agent FinTech Customer Support System
------------------------------------------------------------
Shared module that builds the multi-agent support system for SecureBank.
Used by Modules A–D for observability, evaluation, guardrails, and cost monitoring.

Architecture:
  Query → Supervisor (intent classifier)
        → Policy Agent (RAG over banking docs)
        → Account Agent (mock database lookup)
        → Escalation Agent (empathetic handoff)
